        <p>This page has a culmination of key information we feel is neccessary to know</p>
        <p>Such as key dates, the block periods and key concepts</p>

        <h3>Key Concepts Include</h3>
          <li>decomposition</li>
          <li>abstraction</li>
          <li>generalisation</li>
          <li>algorithms</li>
            <p>THe unit also introduces computational complexity, and discusses the limitations of computation. This unit avoids outright coding, but rather encourages problem solving in a systematic manner.</p>
      <h1>Intended Learning Outcomes</h1>
        <li>Apply techniques such as decomposition, abstraction and generalisation to problems</li>
        <li>Describe computational complexity in an informal way</li>
        <li>Explain how self-referential problems relate to the limits of computation</li>
      <h1>Coursework Advice</h1>
        <p>Remember that the coursework tasks make up 40% of your grade and since they are not done under a conventional exam setting,
          it makes sense to get the most out of them so that you feel more confident going into the exam.
          The two weeks allocated for each coursework should be more than enough for you and your group to come up with a good solution to each problem.
          In terms of how you organise and structure your group work, there are too many ways to list so we will just give you one since it has been tried and tested: meet at least twice over the two weeks, ideally more.
          The chances are, the more you meet as a group, the better your final piece of work will be. If you were to meet, say twice a week, you could use the first session to come up with a solution, go away and transform it into words for your submission,
          then use the second meeting to refine the solution and discuss any outstanding issues.
          Just ensure you and your group follow our advice and communicate properly and this part of the course will be a walk in the park!</p>

Block 1:

What is control flow:

- Control flow is the order the reader or machine carries out the task.


Key ideas with Algorithms:

- Detailed instructions/steps without an overcomplication.
- Control Flow. Uses of statements in the correct order or and properly used without adding extra steps.
- The level it is written at has to be suitable for the target audience. For example if it was written for a little child you would use short precise clear instructions whereas if it was for a machine it would be precise and require more detailed solution.

What are the 2 ways to describe an algorithm:

- Pseudo code.
- Flow chart.

What to look out for when analysing analgorithm:

- Is it correct.
- Speed of output.
- How much memory does it take.
- Does it terminate.

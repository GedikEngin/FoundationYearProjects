Block 4:



What is complexity of an algorithm:

- The number of steps / time or the memory used/space it takes to run the inputs to the desired outputs.


What are the three scenarios used to evaluate algorithms:

- Best case scenario.
- Worse case scenario.
- Average case scenario.


What is the best case scenario:

- It is when we go through the instructions with the least amount of steps taken.

What is the wotse case scenario:

- we take the most possible amount of steps taken to get the worse result.


What does the number of nested loop within it self represent:

- the degree of the set .

Why can't we use a machine to work out the time an algorithm takes:

- Hardware of the machine differ between machines giving different results when running the programme or algorithm.
- The machine/hardware may be built for the programe only therefore causing different results per machine.


What are the two types of counting:

- Fair grained analysis with lots of detail.
	- We count per branch and give that as the answer.

- General analysis, we use this comparing to other algorithms.
	- We use worse case scenario.

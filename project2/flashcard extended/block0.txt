Block 0:

What is a specifcation:

- list of inputs and outputs.
- very precise parameters.

What is an algorithm:

- A precise form on instructions that are used to describe the instructions to solve the problem.

Key thing to avoid when writing an algorithm:

- The use of abiguity within a solution or instruction to a problem.For example using a long word instead of writing the key point in basic english. It provides the reader with a better undewrstanding and a limit any misunderstanding that may occur.
